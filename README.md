# Analysis_of_Airfare
In this project, I cleaned and prepared the data for modeling using SQL and Python for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. I applied several classical machine learning regression models and some deep learning methods to the data, and tested their performance by predicting on a sample dataset. The models were trained and evaluated based on various performance metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error. The project aims to predict the prices of airplane tickets using machine learning and deep learning models, with the goal of providing insights into the dynamics of airfare pricing.
